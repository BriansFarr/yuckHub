### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to search restaurants from the api
- lists violations and food grades
- lists address
- lists cuisine type

#### PostMVP  

- Add second API
- map the restaurants locations with a second api
- display map beside results
